## 11. App Review Notes

**To Apple Review Team:**

POTAL is a price comparison shopping application designed to help consumers find the best deals across major online retailers. The app is a WebView-based application that loads our web service at https://potal.app.

**Key Points for Review:**

1. **Functionality**: The app provides three search methods (text, image, and voice) to compare prices across Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Target, and AliExpress. It is not a store itself but rather a comparison and research tool.

2. **No In-App Purchases**: POTAL is completely free with no in-app purchases, subscriptions, or hidden fees.

3. **External Links**: The app includes links to external retailers (Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Target, AliExpress) which are standard commerce platforms. Users can tap through to make purchases on these platforms directly.

4. **Data Privacy**: The app respects user privacy. All searches are processed securely, and we do not collect or store personal shopping history without user consent. Our privacy policy is available at https://potal.app/privacy.

5. **Camera & Microphone Access**: The app requests camera access for image search functionality and microphone access for voice search functionality. Both permissions are used exclusively for their stated purposes.

6. **Content Restrictions**: POTAL complies with all App Store guidelines. The comparison includes only legitimate consumer products available on major retailers.

7. **Web Content**: As a WebView application, all content is dynamically loaded from our secure web service. We maintain full control over displayed content and ensure compliance with Apple's guidelines.

8. **Support**: Users can access support through https://potal.app.

The app has been thoroughly tested and is ready for distribution. We welcome any questions from the review team.
