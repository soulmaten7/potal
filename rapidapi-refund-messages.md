## 1. Best Buy API 개발자에게 (RapidAPI Discussion/Message)

**API**: Best Buy USA (`bestbuy-usa.p.rapidapi.com`)

> **Subject: Refund Request — API Not Returning Any Responses**
>
> Hi,
>
> I subscribed to the Best Buy USA API for my e-commerce comparison project, but the API has not been returning any responses. Every request results in either a 500 Internal Server Error or no response at all. I've tested multiple endpoints with various queries over several days, but the issue persists.
>
> Since the API is non-functional and I have not been able to use the service at all, I would like to request a full refund for my subscription.
>
> My RapidAPI account email: soulmaten7@gmail.com
>
> Could you please process this refund or let me know the next steps?
>
> Thank you.

## 2. Shein API 개발자에게 (RapidAPI Discussion/Message)

> Hi,
>
> I subscribed to the Unofficial Shein API for my shopping comparison platform. However, the API consistently returns 500 Internal Server Errors on all endpoints I've tried. I've tested with multiple search queries and product IDs over multiple days, but none of the requests have succeeded.
>
> Since the API has been completely non-functional during my entire subscription period, I would like to request a full refund.
>
> My RapidAPI account email: soulmaten7@gmail.com

> Thank you.

## 3. RapidAPI 지원센터 이메일 (support@rapidapi.com)

> **Subject: Refund Request for Non-Functional APIs — Best Buy USA & Unofficial Shein**
>
> Hi RapidAPI Support,
>
> I'm writing to request refunds for two API subscriptions that have been completely non-functional:
>
> **1. Best Buy USA API** (`bestbuy-usa.p.rapidapi.com`)
> - Issue: Returns 500 Internal Server Error or no response on all endpoints
> - I've contacted the API developer through the discussion page but have not received a resolution
>
> **2. Unofficial Shein API** (`unofficial-shein.p.rapidapi.com`)
> - Issue: Returns 500 Internal Server Error on all endpoints consistently
> - I've contacted the API developer through the discussion page but have not received a resolution
>
> Neither API has worked at any point during my subscription. I was unable to make a single successful API call for either service.
>
> **Account email**: soulmaten7@gmail.com
>
> I've already reached out to both API developers directly, but I wanted to follow up with RapidAPI support as well to ensure the refund process moves forward.
>
> Could you please review my usage logs and process refunds for both subscriptions?
>
> Thank you for your help.
>
> Best regards,
> Jang Eun
